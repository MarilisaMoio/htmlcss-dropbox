# READ ME - DROPBOX LOOKALIKE #

### Goals ###
- **Official one**: replicate Dropbox's layout and style starting from a screenshot;
- starting to seek some responsiveness from the project;
- get used to `@media screen`;
- trying to apply some SUIT CSS naming convention to components;
- starting to write some simple documentation in .md (lmao).

### References ###
- [Bootstrap's max-width](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/layout/containers/) breakpoints for `.containers`.

### Considerations ###
- Under 430px in width, everything goes crashing down; otherwise, it adaps decently. Safe with an iPhone 15 Pro Max, tho!
